A train builder for Tiny Rails

I have found that while playing the game [Tiny Rails](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinytitanstudios.TrainChu&hl=en) It is not very easy to experiment with different train builds while within the game. I decided to create this application to make it easier to play with different train builds and add options to optimize your train for various attributes given the cars you currently own.
